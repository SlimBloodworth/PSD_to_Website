## Overview

This project is converting a PhotoShop Document (PSD) into an HTML landing page / single page website.

## My process

- I began by pulling the needed assets using GIMP PhotoShop.
- I saved any images that were more photo related as .jpg for the purposes of optimization and visual appeal.
- I saved overlays and other images as .png for better use.
- I researched and pulled text from Wikipedia to replace the lorem text.
- I researched fonts to find one that most closely matched the design.
- I used a color picker tool to set the variable colors needed according to the design.
- I built the basic structure for the layout in HTML for the hero, as well as the sections, main content, and footer.
- I really liked the hero for this project and wanted to add some parallax to it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JavaScript
- GIMP PhotoShop
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

How to add code snippets:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

A work in progress, I am adding features as I go, and as I encounter needed adjustments.
I am currently working out some responsive aspects.

### Useful resources

- [GIMP Photo Editor](https://www.gimp.org/) - I love open source and I really like using GIMP for photo shopping.
