## My process

- I began by pulling the needed assets using GIMP PhotoShop.
- I saved any images that were more photo related as .jpg for the purposes of optimization and visual appeal.
- I researched and pulled text from Wikipedia to replace the lorem text.
- I researched fonts to find one that most closely matched the design.
- I used a color picker tool to set the variable colors needed according to the design.
- I built the basic structure for the layout in HTML for the hero, as well as the sections, main content, and footer.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- GIMP PhotoShop
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
